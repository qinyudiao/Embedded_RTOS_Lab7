 * @brief Interface to two DC motors controlled by PWM. Allows differential driving.
 * 
 * Conventions:
 *  - Definition of "left" versus "right":
 *      - The "left motor" is the motor on your left when the robot is on the ground with the servo pointed away from you.
 *      - The "right motor" is the motor on your right when the robot is on the ground with the servo pointed away from you.
 *  - How to connect motors to motor board:
 *      - The left motor must be connected to motor port A.
 *      - The right motor must be connected to motor port B.
 *  - Motor pin assignments:
 *      - The red wire of the left motor will be connected to A- and is controlled by PB6
 *      - The black wire of the left motor will be connected to A+ and is controlled by PB7
 *      - The red wire of right motor will be connected to B- and is controlled by PB4
 *      - The black wire of the right motor will be connected to B+ and is controlled by PB5
 *  - Pin configurations:
 *      - A- (PB6) and B+ (PB5) will be configured as PWM outputs
 *      - A+ (PB7) and B- (PB4) will be configured as digital outputs.
 *      - We alternate + and - so that when both motors are driving forward (i.e. they are rotating OPPOSITE directions)
 *        with the same torque, their digital and PWM output configurations will be identical.
 *  - H-Bridge convention:
 *      - A value of 1 (high) on any of PB4/5/6/7 will connect the corresponding motor terminal (A/B/+/-) to battery power.
 *      - A value of 0 (low) on any of PB4/5/6/7 will connect the corresponding motor terminal (A/B/+/-) to ground.
